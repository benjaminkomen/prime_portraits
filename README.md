# Prime portraits
This cli program lets you convert any image to a prime portrait image.
Copied and slightly modified from [here](https://github.com/rmeertens/prime_portraits).

Note: Work in Progress.

## Usage
- Put the image you want to use in the folder `input_images`
- Run `pipenv install` (if you don't have pipenv, first do `pip3 install pipenv`)
to set up your environment.
-  Run `pipenv run python main.py` to run the script.
